# SOUNDQR 🎵

> Transform your music into shareable QR codes with embedded metadata and FLAC audio support.

## Overview

SOUNDQR is a innovative tool that builds upon [STARWEB](https://github.com/isdood/STARWEB)'s QR code experimentation foundation to create a specialized music-sharing platform. This project aims to bridge the gap between physical and digital music sharing through the power of QR codes.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Create a seamless system for encoding FLAC audio files into QR codes
- Preserve high-quality audio while maintaining reasonable QR code complexity
- Enable rich metadata embedding (artist info, album art, lyrics, etc.)
- Develop an intuitive front-end application for easy encode/decode operations

## 🔑 Key Features

### Planned Features
- **FLAC Codec Integration**: High-fidelity audio preservation
- **Intelligent QR Segmentation**: Handle large audio files through multi-QR sequences
- **Metadata Management**: 
  - Track information
  - Album artwork
  - Lyrics
  - Artist details
  - Music credits
- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Drag-and-drop file handling
  - QR code generation
  - Scanner functionality
  - Metadata editor

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

The project will consist of several key components:

1. **Core Encoder/Decoder**
   - FLAC processing engine
   - QR code generation/reading
   - Data chunking and reconstruction

2. **Metadata Handler**
   - ID3/Vorbis comment parsing
   - Custom metadata schema

3. **Front-End Application**
   - Modern, responsive interface
   - Real-time QR code preview
   - Batch processing capabilities

## 💡 Use Cases
